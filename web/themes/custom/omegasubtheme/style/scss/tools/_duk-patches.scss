// Duk Patches
//
// This use this to store patches/fixes/additions to DUK which you port upstream at a later time.
//
// Eg.
// If you found a bug with `duk-font-weight()`, you can correct it here and test throughout your site
// then at a later time do a PR for the change without being blocked by some faulty code.
//
// Any new additions (mixins/functions/etc) should be name spaced `duk`
